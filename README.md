# Introduction
This service takes care of Car Lease Management APIs using JWT token
This service will invoke iam-service using Feign client to validate JWT token

# Endpoints
1. Endpoints exposed in this swagger page http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui/index.html

# Credentials to login/authorize
1. Copy the generated token from 'iam-service' swagger page(/login endpoint)-(http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
2. Click Authorize and give the jwt token  to execute needed endpoints

# Architecture of this assessment(customer-service)

# Technologies/Frameworks used in local
1. InteliJ Latest version
2. Java 17
3. Maven version 3.9.5
4. Spring Boot Version 3.1.0
5. postgresql
6. Junit
7. Swagger(http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui/index.html)

# How to configure in local
1. Download repo from github
2. Refer # Technologies/Frameworks used in local to download needed software
3. Refer Postgresql installment section
4. Do 'mvn clean install'
5. Run spring boot main application
6. After app started, use http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui/index.html
7. Give JWT token generated from /login endpoint of iam-service(http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
8. Once you have Authorized using jwt token, click needed endpoint to perform required action

#  Postgresql installment section
1. Start the PostgreSQL server:
   pg_ctl start -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\data"
2. Login to the PostgreSQL database:
   psql -U postgres
3. After login execute below cmd to create DB:
   CREATE DATABASE carlease_db
4. Switch to DB using below cmd:
   \c carlease_db
5. Below cmd to create Table Lease:
   CREATE TABLE Lease (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   customer_id BIGINT,
   car_id BIGINT,
   mileage INT,
   duration INT,
   interest_rate DOUBLE PRECISION,
   nett_price DOUBLE PRECISION,
   lease_rate DOUBLE PRECISION
   );

# Improvements can be made-Due to time constraints I could not do the below
1. Unit test cases are not yet covered for controller and service due to time constraints. **But it is same as what I have done for car-service**.
2. By exposing this microservice to API Gateway , we can configure rate limit and prevent DDOS attack
3. Due to time constraints, I could not create docker for this.
4. Some validations on the user input fields could have been done by sanitizing the inputs fields to avoid/escape html characters
5. We can enable retry on 500 error when invoking iam-service, car-service and customer-service
